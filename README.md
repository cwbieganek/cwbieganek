# About Me

Hi there! My name is Chris Bieganek. I am the Lead GIS Developer for Westwood Professional Services located in Minnetonka, MN. I specialize in creating GIS web applications and geoprocessing scripts.

I am currently working on expanding my portfolio of custom GIS web applications using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and OpenLayers. I also recently got hooked on the Rust programming language, and I look forward to exploring that more once I have several custom GIS web applications under my belt.

These are the programming languages and technologies that I have used:

- JavaScript: Primarily TypeScript these days
- SvelteKit: This is currently my favorite way to develop web applications
- React.js: When I am not using SvelteKit I use React, because of its maturity, support, and ecosystem
- Python: Used for geoprocessing scripts (arcpy) and scripts that are run periodically on our GIS server
- C#: Used to create ArcPro plugins, AutoCAD plugins, and Windows desktop applications
- Rust: I will primarily be using Rust to build microservices that can be compiled into extremely small Docker images
- C: Used to create a command line tool for extracting GPS data from GoPro videos
- GeoServer: I have a personal instance of GeoServer that I use to host data for my GIS web applications
